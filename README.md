## üíª [About the Project](#this-link-is-just-for-styling)
Best described as YouTube's front-end rebuilt from scratch in React, with a total redesign to improve UX. Since this is just the front-end, for now all the users, videos, comments, and channels are pseudo-randomly generated. This project was a sort of preview for me to see how much work would be involved in building a real social media platform, and to hone my javascript/react skills.

### Features:
- Native mobile UI
- Real Playable Videos
- Comment System
- Channels
- Search functionality
- Infinite Scroll
- Lazy Loading
- Likes/Dislikes

### What I Learned:
- Building custom Webpack, babel, and eslint configs
- Chrome dev tools 
	* Using performance profiling/network tab to analyze bottlenecks in data & source code
	* Understanding JS Heap sizes, dom nodes, and how they impact performance differently on PC/mobile
	* Remote debugging of mobile devices via Remote devices tab
	* Solving light house audit recommendations
	* Using source maps
- React Dev Tools to analyze state & react-router data
- React Profiler's Flamegraph to snuff out unnecessary re-rendering
- Code splitting via react lazy/suspense
- Intersection observer API for infinite scrolling
- Lazy loading & caching with vanilla JS
- Optimizing a web app for mobile performance
- React hooks (basic hooks + useCallback, and useRef)
- Storing & pulling data from local storage
